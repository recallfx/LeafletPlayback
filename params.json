{"name":"LeafletPlayback (recallfx)","tagline":"This is a Leaflet plug-in that plays back points that have a time stamp synchronized to a clock.","body":"# Leaflet Playback\r\n\r\nLeaflet Playback provides the ability to replay GPS Tracks in the form of GeoJSON objects. Rather than simply animating a marker along a polyline, the speed of the animation is synchroized to a clock. The playback functionality is similar to a video player--you can start and stop playback, change the playback speed, load GPS tracks, as well as set the playback time with a slider or calendar/time-picker widget.\r\n\r\n## [View Demo](http://leafletplayback.theoutpost.io)\r\n\r\nThis demo pre-loads some GPS GeoJSON tracks and lets you play them back.\r\n\r\n## GPS Data Format\r\n\r\nLeaflet Playback consumes GPS tracks in the form of GeoJSON. The next feature to be implemented for the plugin is the added ability to parse GPX tracks as well. The schema of the GeoJSON data is as follows: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"Feature\",\r\n  \"geometry\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"MultiPoint\",\r\n    \"coordinates\": [/*array of [lng,lat] coordinates*/]\r\n  },\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"time\": [/*array of UNIX timestamps*/]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther attributes may be added to the GeoJSON object, but this is the required minimum schema for the plug-in to work.\r\n\r\nGeoJSON tracks can be added dynamically to Leaflet Playback by calling:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nplayback.addTracks(tracks);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar playback = new L.Playback(map, demoTracks, clockCallback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere map is your Leaflet map object, demoTracks is a GeoJSON object or an array of GeoJSON objects, and clockCallback is a function you feed it that will send the timestamp value on each tick.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is a fork of @hallahan LeafletPlayback plugin.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
